This is actually a good implementation of spring JPA Specification interface.
Just code 5 classed to extend Spring Boot Repository with Hibernate. 
Then front-end have full control of filtering data with no back-end changes.

Querying with spring-repository-plus is as simple as:

HTTP POST  the JSON string, and you can filter data based on any column.
